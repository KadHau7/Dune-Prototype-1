Program Kwisatz Haderach/Dune Prototype 1:

The idea of this program is to allow users to be interactive with the program.
The program ask users for their name and a question as the input.
Once completed the program would then tell the user an answer which would be a line from the movie.
What I'm trying to add is a continiuation of the program that would allow the user to ask another question, and for the program to generte another answer.
That is currently what bugging me right now, if anyone has any recommendations I'm all ears it's my first project, i just started programming in Python.
I'm open to learning
